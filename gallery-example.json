Once, you're there go north and talk to the scifag, who will drop a Hyperlink. Pick it up and insert it into the \"Portal to /jp/\". Go to /jp/. Go north to pick up 1 bowl of Ramen, you will need it later. Now, head South. When you come across a dumpster, open it and take the Butter and the Fake ID, which is needed to get into another place in /jp/. You'll also want to pick up the Pokeball, which is in the room with the Tentacle Monster. After getting the Pokeball, get back to where you entered /jp/. Now, go west first. When you get the choice, go north; there you will find a DDR machine. Use it! Pick up the code and go south until you get to Shii's box. Take the box, open it and take the Shii. (If you go eastwards, from here, you will find a secret room, which contains the \"Bag of Holding\". It's nice to have a secret in this kind of game, but it's not all that useful, to be honest) Go back to the room, in which you entered /jp/ and now go east. Talk to Watanabe and he will give you an Afro, which will also be needed, very soon. Now head north and take the Hitachi Magic Wand.",

Go to (2|1) and open the rock to find another Machine Code. After that, go to (3|1) and, from here, climb down. Use Battletoads on the WOPR and take the apple (it could as well be a cherry, though). Head back up and then to field (2|3). Go down. Talk to Error and pick up 1 Mysql_error. You'll also want 1 fire. Once you got the Mysql_error and the fire, go to (1|3), burn the bush and descend into the Barrel-room. Pick up the Barrel, open it, take the cloud. Now, go to (1|1). Descend into the Dwarven Fortress and follow the path to The Guy. (Don't worry, this will not be as hard as the actual IWBTG.) Use the Apple (or cherry) on him (You see? This wasn't that hard ^^).
